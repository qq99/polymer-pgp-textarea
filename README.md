polymer-pgp-textarea
====================

This is supposed to be / going to be a textarea that supports PGP via [openpgpjs](https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs/)

I'm playing with [Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org/)

Currently, it's just using a fake key.

To test it out,
- `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`
- visit [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
